## Abstract

Everyday, teachers across the nation engage in the crucial activity of taking attendance. By taking classroom attendance, teachers not only quantify the effort and dedication of individual students, but also motivate students to come to school by rewarding them for their dedication. Furthermore, the process of attendance allows schools to keep track of each student as they progress through their day and is a basic standard for maintaining the safety of each individual student. This process, however, can come at the cost of valuable instructional time. For example, take Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, one of the nationâ€™s top high schools. Every week approximately 1700 students at TJHSST traverse through 25 periods. Assuming that the process of attendance takes 5 minutes per class, TJ, as a whole, spends 212500 minutes or 3542 hours each week on attendance. Attendance is a task that is replicated frequently everyday and is therefore a task that is prime for automation. This paper assumes a novel approach to classroom attendance by treating it as an extension of Multi-View Group Facial Recognition In The Wild.
